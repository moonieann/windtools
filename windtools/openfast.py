    """Write out Binary HAWC-Style Full-Field Files

    From the InflowWind manual:
    ```
    HAWC FF files are 3-dimensional data sets (functions of x, y, and z) of the
    3-component wind inflow velocity, u, v, w. The data are stored in a nx × ny
    × nz evenly-spaced grid, V(x,y,z).
    
    HAWC-style binary files do not contain any header information. All data
    necessary to read and scale it must be entered in the InflowWind input file.
    Each data file contains the wind speed for a specific wind component, stored
    as 4-byte real numbers.
    ```

    These were selected as the preferred input format due to the format
    simplicity. This function generates u.bin, v.bin, and w.bin from an xarray
    Dataset with dimensions 't', 'y', and 'z' in a turbine frame of reference
    (x is streamwise, z is up) and with variables 'u','v', and 'w' corresponding
    to the velocity components.
